## How to play

- The game starts by choosing randomly the team wich starts the game, with the frisbee.
- The goal is to pass the frisbee to a player inside the spawn of the defending team, while the defending team tries to stop this by intersecting the disk.
- If a goal is scored the teams switch roles and reset positions. The previously attacking team wins a point.
- To intersect the disk a defender must be in it's trajectory while it's being passed. There's a fixed chance for each trajectory intersection.
- If the disk is intersected by the defenders, the teams switch roles.
- Moves:
  1. 3 moves (attacking team) 
  1. 5 moves (defending team)
  1. 1 move + 1 pass (attacking team)
